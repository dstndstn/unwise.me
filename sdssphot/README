Directory contents:

* sdss-collab: password-protected data private to the SDSS collabroation.

* sdss-dr10d-fields.fits: a table of SDSS fields for which forced photometry exists.

* sdss-dr10d-tiles.fits: a table of WISE coadd tiles for which forced photometry exists.

* specmatch-dr10.fits: SDSS DR10 spectra matched to our WISE photomtery.
    This is the "specObj-dr10.fits" file augmented with our photometry for
    matching rows.
      http://data.sdss3.org/datamodel/files/SPECTRO_REDUX/specObj.html

* sdss-dr10d-pobj: our WISE photometry results, in files that are row-by-row parallel to the SDSS DR10 "photoObj" files,
      http://data.sdss3.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_PHOTOOBJ/RERUN/RUN/CAMCOL/photoObj.html
    The directory structure is the same too;
      %(run)i/%(camcol)i/photoWiseForced-%(run)06i-%(camcol)i-%(field)04i.fits

* sdss-dr10d-pobj-tgz: tarballs, one per run, of the above.

* sdss-dr10d-phot: our WISE photometry results, in files corresponding to WISE coadd tiles.
    These include SDSS sources within the tile, plus a margin.  The same SDSS object may appear in multiple tiles.
    The filename is based on the WISE tile name, which encodes an approximate RA,Dec center;
      phot-RRRR[pm]DDD.fits
    is the tile centered at roughly RRR.R degrees RA, DD.D degrees Dec.

* sdss-dr10d-SEDs: "I just want RA,Dec, and the SDSS and WISE SEDs."  Reasonable enough request!
  These tables (one per SDSS run+camcol) contain:
   1 ra               D
   2 dec              D
   3 pointsource      L
   4 w1_nanomaggies   E
   5 w1_nanomaggies_ivar E
   6 w2_nanomaggies   E
   7 w2_nanomaggies_ivar E
   8 w3_nanomaggies   E
   9 w3_nanomaggies_ivar E
  10 w4_nanomaggies   E
  11 w4_nanomaggies_ivar E
  12 sdss_flux        5E
  13 sdss_flux_ivar   5E
  where "pointsource" = SDSS point source or treated_as_pointsource,
        "sdss_flux" = SDSS PSF flux for "pointsource" objects, "cmodelflux" otherwise.

* md5sums-dr10d-pobj: checksums for the sdss-dr10d-pobj directory.
   Pro tip: you could edit this file to produce a "wget" script, if you
   were so inclined.

* md5sums-dr10d-phot: checksums for the sdss-dr10d-phot directory.
